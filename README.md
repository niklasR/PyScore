PyScore
=======

A keyable scoreboard, implemented in Python.

Includes a webserver for remote control of the display (by default on port 8000), and a local GUI offering the same controls.

All implemented in Tkinter, so no additional python libraries necessary.
To start the programm automaticially on the Raspberry Pi when it is plugged in, make sure you have GUI boot disabled, and follow: https://web.archive.org/web/20140827203058/http://raspberrypi.stackexchange.com/questions/12324/how-do-i-get-a-gui-program-to-run-before-the-login-screen/12514
